title: 'Classes I have taken at Notre Dame'

One of the most common questions underclassmen have asked me over the years is "What classes have you taken at Notre Dame?"

Before I answer that question, I wanted to quickly describe the academic landscape Notre Dame CS is with respect to other schools. This opinion is extremely subjective, however, I believe there is some validity to it.

By following the base curriculum at Notre Dame found [here](https://cse.nd.edu/undergraduate/computer-science-curriculum/), you will be "ok". "ok" meaning you will be in the top 20ish percentile of candidates in the national pool. Leaving alum connection out of the equation, this is not good enough. With the recent evolution of AI, companies are getting leaner and want highly specialized CS candidates. Especially since everyone is slapping CS on their resumes, the CS title is ever so "fatty". 

## Doing the bare minimum is not enough.

The following advice applies to any academic setting you may find yourself. Your mindset and grind to get things done will put you minimum in the top 5 percentile of applicants. Notre Dame is not renowned (at this moment) as a MIT or Stanford, so it doesn't get the pull of the Google's and Apple's of the world. Recruiting is tough. You must put in the extra hours to elevate and separate yourself from others. Following the mean in my opinion is how you get forgotten. 

## Do more. 

While there are a bunch of caveats of what I just said, overall it is good advice.
