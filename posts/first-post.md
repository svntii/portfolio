Hello to anyone that comes across this page!


 My first blog post ... feels weird as I write this on a bus at ~2am on a bus to Atlanta. But working these past fews days on multiple projects, trying to immerse myself in more technical knowledge exhilirating - more on that in future posts.

In the following posts, I will try to share an inside scoop on my brain. I hope these provide value to someone in the future. 

    - Santiago Rodriguez
    - Age: 23
    - Incoming Software Engineer at Apple

We will see how much that changes :)
