Created a Visualizer/Interpreter for a Lambda Calculus terms with their respective types.

## Responsibilities

- Learned how to define programming languages using operational semantics and type systems, and how to prove things about them.
- Implemented an Interpreter for Lambda Calculus Interpreter, a simple programming language that is built up, with higher-order functions and lexical scope; algebraic data types, polymorphic types, and type inference; state and control.
- Analyzed different design + semantic methods such as big and small step evalution to ensure our Interpreters had the intended consequences.
- Studied the developments and implementation of functional languages such as OCaml and Scheme.
