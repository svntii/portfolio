This project was completed as part of the course CSE 40243: Compilers and Language Design at the University of Notre Dame. 
The project was intended to implement this language spec defined [here](https://dthain.github.io/compilers-fa22/bminor.html) by [Dr. Douglas Thain](https://dthain.github.io/). The project was broken down into five steps, requiring the construction of a scanner, parser, printer, type checker, and code generator. The project was completed in C++ and used the Flex and Bison tools to generate the scanner and parser.

## Responsibilities

- Constructed a working compiler that transforms C into x86 assembly code.
- The project was broken down into five steps, requiring the construction of a scanner, parser, type checker, source translator, and code generator.
- From this project I was able to learn topics ranging from the abstract theory of automata to the very practical details of assembly languages.
