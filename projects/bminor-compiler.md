A compiler for the B-Minor programming language


---

## Responsibilities

- Constructed a working compiler that transforms C into x86 assembly code.
- The project was broken down into five steps, requiring the construction of a scanner, parser, type checker, source translator, and code generator.
- From this project I was able to learn topics ranging from the abstract theory of automata to the very practical details of assembly languages.
